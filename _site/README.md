====================

My portfolio website build with Jekyll and some help of Meny a project of [@Hakimel](github.com/hakimel/Meny)

I used the following tools for this project.

* [Atom](atom.oi) - Main code editor.
* [Sketch 3](bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) - To create visuals and SVG.
* [Grunt](gruntjs.com) - For compiling Jekyll and merging SVG files.

All of the above programes i never or hardly used before, but the goal is to learn something new and trying to make the switch from the conventional programs.
