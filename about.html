        About Katie
      </h2>

      <h4>Designer in Austin, Texas. A midwest monster of the highest grade.</h4>

      <div class="article-text">
        
        <p>Katie is a designer at Happy Cog. She has a degree in advertising and graphic design from Columbus College of Art &amp; Design where she fell in love with lettering and paper. Her passion for typography and layouts transcended her to shift from print to web design. She currently teaches with the lovely ladies at Girl Develop It Austin.</p>

        <p>When her face isn’t pressed against her computer screen she can be found obsessing over her dog, riding her bike and playing pinball. She can’t resist (another) red lipstick or bad karaoke.</p>

        <p>You can read her elsewhere on the internet:</p>
